INTRODUCTION
============
This tool originally written by NetApp(R) underwent extensive rewrite
at Sun(R) in order to be usable as a test tool for implementation of NDMP
daemon on Solaris(R). Until opensolaris(R) was shut down by Oracle(R) it
was available from opensolaris.org website for download. Nexenta(R)
did changes to build system to get rid of old cruft and make it usable
with gmake and gcc. Still the only supported platform is Solaris/Illumos.

DESCRIPTION
===========
Ndmpcopy transfers data between filers using the Network Data
Management Protocol (NDMP) version 4.  When you use rsh to 
perform this transfer, the data flows from the source machine 
to the rsh host and then again from the rsh host to the 
destination machine.  This can put a double load on the network 
and unneccessary load on the rsh host.  With ndmpcopy, data is 
transferred directly from the source machine to the destination 
machine, and the NDMP host and network are not burdoned with 
the extra load.

When you run ndmpcopy it will contact the NDMP server processes on
the source and destination machines and authenticate the connection.
It will then initiate a backup on the source machine and a restore
on the destination machine.  The transfer will happen between the
two machines directly, only burdoning the NDMP host with status
messages instead of all of the backup data.  Initial tests have
demonstrated double the performance when using ndmpcopy instead
of rsh.

BUILDING THE ndmpcopy
======================
Pre-requisites:
1. Sun Solaris 10 and above Operating System is required.
2. GCC compiler
3. GNU make

To build ndmpcopy:

 gmake

To install it to $DESTDIR (by default ./proto):

 gmake install

COMPATIBILITY
==============
This version of ndmpcopy has been tested on NexentaStor system.
